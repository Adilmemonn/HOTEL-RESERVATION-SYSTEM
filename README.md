This Hotel RESERVATION System is a software application designed to automate the management of hotel operations such as room bookings, customer check-in/check-out, and payments using Java's Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) principles. The system also uses JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) to handle database interactions such as storing and retrieving customer information, room details, and booking records.
